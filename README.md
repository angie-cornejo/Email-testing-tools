# Email-testing-tools

This is a small project that evaluates email testing tools in practice. 

The test involved attempting to reset a password using both the Gmail API and Mailosaur. After retrieving the respective emails, their HTML content was rendered to visually inspect and verify the correctness and layout of the messages.
